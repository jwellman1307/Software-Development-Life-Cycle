# Software-Development-Life-Cycle

In the software development life cycle(SDLC), there are multiple methodolgies that can followed depending on the type of project. My focus on this project were agile and waterfall methodologies. The power point presentation focuses on the agile and waterfall methodologies while the scrum master report will focus more on user stories. I interpreted user needs and implemented them into a program with the help of user stories. Creating user stories helps break down what the user is looking for in the project into smaller chunks making user stories easier to understand and make it more manageable to be completed in a reasonable time. For future development, I would like to get involved in programs like Jira. I like the idea of being connected with other team members and viewing the project all in one place. Kanban boards and scrum meetings would also be processes that I hope to incorporate into future development. Being a good team member in software development means keeping open communication with other team members, having integrity toward your work, and showing respect toward one another. An agile software development team should consist of a wide variety of skill sets, and a good team member should know how to communicate and collaborate with these skill sets.
