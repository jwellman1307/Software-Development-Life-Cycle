# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## Overview
This repository demonstrates practical understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) with a focus on Agile and Waterfall methodologies. The project includes documentation and presentation materials that illustrate how structured development processes, user stories, and team collaboration contribute to successful software delivery.

Rather than focusing on code implementation, this project emphasizes planning, communication, and process design — critical components of real-world software and automation projects.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- Agile vs. Waterfall methodologies
- Scrum roles and responsibilities
- User stories and requirement breakdown
- Team communication and collaboration
- Process documentation and presentation

## Agile & Scrum Focus
The Scrum Master report highlights how user stories are used to translate business and user needs into actionable development tasks. These stories help break complex requirements into manageable units, improving clarity, prioritization, and delivery timelines.

The project emphasizes:
- Incremental development
- Clear communication across team roles
- Continuous feedback loops
- Accountability and transparency within the team

## Process & Collaboration Principles
Strong software development outcomes rely on more than technical skills alone. This project reinforces the importance of:
- Open and consistent communication
- Cross-functional collaboration
- Integrity and ownership of work
- Respect for diverse skill sets within a team

These principles are directly applicable to Agile teams, automation initiatives, and large-scale operational environments.

## Tools & Methodologies Referenced
